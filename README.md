Different models of a vending machine that keeps track of its inventory, money, and transactions

The vending machine has 3 different models. 
Model 100A accepts one-dollar bill only and gives back change using coins.
Model 100B accepts coins and one-dollar bills but returns change in coins only.
Model 100C accepts credit card payment only and rejects purchase after two invalid cc entries. 

All credit card numbers must have 13-16 digits and start with 4, 5, 37, or 6.

The secret code of "abc" is entered by an operator. Once the operator initiates the system, customers
can make purchases by selecting the machine first, then an item, and finally a purchase amount.

The system will generate a detailed report of each machine in an output file and then shut down all machines.
